[GentooX vision]
- original idea was for GentooX OS files to be read-only, and user apps would
  only be installed via flatpak, freebsd like system separation, GentooX would be updatable via binary delta files,
  thanks to CoW feature of BTRFS, you would be able to e.g. boot April or May release of GentooX

- alternative idea was to utilize BTRFS CoW to perform upgrades (e.g. update Jan
  2021 install to March 2021) from a March 2021 LiveCD by snapshotting current
  install and extracting new image.squashfs to existing system and persisting
  only users' /home directories, resulting is superfast upgrades and ability
  to boot back previous snapshot of the system from GRUB (much like Solaris on
  ZFS)
